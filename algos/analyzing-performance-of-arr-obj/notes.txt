Big O of objects
- Insertion - o(1)
- removal - o(1)
- searching - o(n)
- access - o(1)

searching is not constant because you have to check every single item

when to use arrays
- When yoou need order
- when you need fast access / insertion and removal (sort of)

If you have a 10,000 item array and ask for item 5,000 it doesn't have to go through each item as there is a direct reference to go right to it.

push / pop = O(1), basically all others are O(n), sort is O(N * log N)
